 *
 * Algorithm  (Topological Order)
 *
 * Initialize a stack S that will contain the topologically sorted order of the courses in our graph.
 * Construct the adjacency list using the edge pairs given in the input.
 * An important thing to note about the input for the problem is that a pair such as [a, b] represents
 * that the course b needs to be taken in order to do the course a. This implies an edge of the form b âž” a.
 * Please take note of this when implementing the algorithm.
 *
 * For each of the nodes in our graph, we will run a depth first search in case that node was not already visited
 * in some other node's DFS traversal.
 *
 * Suppose we are executing the depth first search for a node N. We will recursively traverse all of the neighbors
 * of node N which have not been processed before.
 * Once the processing of all the neighbors is done, we will add the node N to the stack. We are making use of a
 * stack to simulate the ordering we need. When we add the node N to the stack, all the nodes that require the node
 * N as a prerequisites (among others) will already be in the stack.
 * Once all the nodes have been processed, we will simply return the nodes as
 * they are present in the stack from top to bottom.
 *
 *
 * Start from any node, but be sure that dependency direction points that way:
 *
 * if A depends on B, and B depends on C
 *
 * The direction of dependency is   C -> B -> A
 *
 * So, we start exploration, for example from B and thus we build list:
 *
 * A B
 *
 * Then we start exploration from remaining C and this C added:
 *
 * A B C
 *
 * The we print in reverse order: C (B depends on C), B (A depends on B) , and finally A
 *
 *
